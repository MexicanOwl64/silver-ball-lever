# Physical 
-We need to make a physical prototype to see how the product will work.
-The protoype should have something rantagular held by two pegs and move the begs up and down to see how the rectangle (ramp) will react to the motion
- After collecting the data and taking pictures or videos implements discover to the game. 

# What button should it be?
- If it is on computer considred using WASD or the arrow keys as a starting scheme for the begining idea. 
- On other consoles like mobile have button inputs that contorl the resprective side of the shape
- On controllers like Xbox and Playstation should be using the left and right alanog stick to control the ramp
-In the interest of moving forward only focus on the arrow keys and WASD as of right now.
